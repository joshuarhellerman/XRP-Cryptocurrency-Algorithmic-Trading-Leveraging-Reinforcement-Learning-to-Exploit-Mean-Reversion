# **XRP Cryptocurrency Algorithmic Trading: Leveraging Reinforcement Learning to Exploit Mean Reversion**

## 📈 Overview

This project demonstrates an **algorithmic trading strategy** applied to **XRP cryptocurrency** using **reinforcement learning** to identify and exploit **mean reversion opportunities**. The notebook contains code to develop, backtest, and optimize a trading strategy with the goal of generating risk-adjusted returns in a highly volatile market.

The project includes:

- **Data fetching**: Pulling historical XRP data from various sources.
- **Preprocessing and feature engineering**: Creating indicators to detect price reversions.
- **Reinforcement learning model**: Training an agent to determine optimal entry and exit points.
- **Performance evaluation**: Using metrics like Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and cumulative returns.

## 🚀 Key Features

1. **Reinforcement Learning Model**:
   - A Q-learning agent is trained to learn profitable actions based on XRP price data.
   - The model dynamically adjusts for mean reversion conditions.

2. **Mean Reversion Detection**:
   - Detects price deviations and reversion patterns in XRP using statistical indicators.

3. **Risk Management**:
   - Implements a **dynamic stop-loss mechanism** to minimize losses.
   - Evaluates model performance with **Sharpe ratio** and **maximum drawdown**.
